# GridForecast: Electricity Demand Predictor
GridForecast is an end-to-end electricity demand forecasting system built on real-time ENTSO-E operational data, combining time series analytics (ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM), ensemble modeling, automated monitoring, and continuous retraining to enable data-driven grid operations and energy trading decisions.

From insights derived from temporal demand patterns and renewable energy variability, actionable forecasting models were developed and deployed via an interactive web application. The application provides a dashboard interface for grid operators and energy traders to 
visualize 24-hour demand predictions, confidence intervals, and real-time model performance to support operational planning and risk mitigation.
